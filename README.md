ABOUT
-----

This app is a simple solution to quickly finding cocktails and their ingredients based on their type (long-drink or shot), one
ingredient and their alcoholic content. As a user, you can apply any filter you want and press *APPLY* to filter for the 
desired cocktail. The *RESET* button enables the user to reset the filter options so that all cocktails are viewable on the page.
